# Math in Our Democracy: Detecting and Preventing Gerrymandering

I taught this "Jan term" course in January 2020, 2021, and 2022.  I loved teaching this course, and the students seemed to get a lot out of it.  I have many resources that I can share, and I also used many resources from the [MGGG](https://mggg.org/) teacher trainings that happened in 2018.  Please contact me directly if you'd like any resources.  Here is the outline of the course:
