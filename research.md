# Research

My research interests include the intersection of combinatorics, convex geometry, metric geometry, fairness, and computation.  Recently, my research has focused on using computational and mathematical techniques to address gerrymandering and understand the space of redistricting maps, as well as fairness in machine learning.

**Students:**   I would love to talk with you about research project ideas to study the redistricting metagraph, study multi-member districts, and other ideas I have in the study of redistricting maps.  I'm also interested in using machine learning techniques to improve medical care, particularly for marginalized communities. I'd also love to talk with you about your research interests!
