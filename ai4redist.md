# AI for Redistricting

I taught this for the first time in Spring 2024.  Students finished the course with a final project, analyzing a state/map of their choice.  Here is some sample student work:

[North Carolina 2022 and 2023 Congressional Redistricting Map Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q3GVK53vQy0S720Qj0sG6fuPAWyIrNas/view?usp=sharing), by Qianru Wei and Mingda Ma 		

[North Dakota Redistricting Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ff0zkMxO5aYTX9TF8p6cbL84ScMFWQK_/view?usp=sharing) by Kushal Chekuri and Pedro Pinheiro

### Here is an outline of the topics:


* Intro, Shape and population
  * Include graphs and dual graphs
* Metrics: eg, mean median, geo 
* Markov Chains and outlier analysis
  * What are MCs
  * MCs in redistricting: flip, recom 
  * Theory of MCs 
* Data wrangling
* Ecological Inference
* Short bursts
  * With finding VRA districts 
  * With testing metrics
* Extra topics (for example: GEO metric, Declination, the redistricting metagraph, machine learning to measure district compactness . . . )
* Project work
