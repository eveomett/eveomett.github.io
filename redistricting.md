# Redistricting and Computational Democracy

## *New-ish*: [Click here for states repos](https://github.com/eveomett-states)!

**Guest Editing:**  Kristopher Tapp and I will be guest editing the [Mathematical and Computational Democracy](https://link.springer.com/collections/fjgfgbbgeb) special collection of La Matematica.  [Here is the call for papers](https://link.springer.com/journal/44007/updates/27816096).

**Research Programs:**

In Spring 2026, I'll be participating in the [Mathematics of Elections, Fairness, and Representation Workshop](https://www.birs.ca/events/2026/5-day-workshops/26w5503) at the [Banff International Research Station](https://www.birs.ca/)

In Summer 2024, I participated in the [Mathematics of Voting and Representation Workshop](https://icms.ac.uk/activities/workshop/mathematics-of-voting-and-representation-a-mathematics-for-humanity-workshop/) at the [Edinburgh Futures Institute](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/) through the [International Centre for Mathematical Sciences](https://icms.ac.uk/)

Fall of 2023, I was a Research Member at the [MSRI/SLMath Algorithms, Fairness, and Equity](https://www.slmath.org/programs/353) Program

**Data Cleaning:**

USF graduate students Ananya Agarwal, Alusi, Arbie Hsu, Arif Syraj, and I have cleaned and coalesced data for post-2020-Census maps.  See our [paper](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol23/iss3/6/) for details (published in [The Mathematics Enthusiast](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol23/iss3/6/)); the maps can be found at [https://github.com/eveomett-states](https://github.com/eveomett-states)

**Teaching:**

Spring 2024, 2025, and 2026 I taught [AI for Redistricting](ai4redist.md).

I taught [Math in our Democracy: Detecting and Preventing Gerrymandering](mathindem.md) three times during "Jan term" (Januaries of 2020, 2021, and 2022)
