# IMMERSE Course Resources

## These are some resources from the IMMERSE course that I taught in 2010 at the University of Nebraska.  I taught a similar course during the Spring quarter of 2011 at Cal State East Bay.

## I hope that these help you to design a similar course.  If you'd like additional resources, please feel free to contact me!

[Schedule](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HUt9K0syo1cXBoY1JkanYwa2s/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-hud0jHjdT81AbQVRhOfTLw): This shows the general list and order of the topics that I lectured on, when I taught the class at Cal State.  You'll notice that the first topic is Metric spaces, and near the end we see the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma and the F. John Ellipsoid.  This shows that we cover only what what is necessary in order to get where we want to go, and we give just a basic understanding of those more advanced topics. 

[Homework 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HUt9K0syo1UUVTNWJ1QkZNcjg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-GVTknZQCuP7cOwkt8JWchg):  One of the earlier homeworks during the "Lecture Stage."

[Homework 7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HUt9K0syo1QW51UVJOeWRiMEU/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-Iz0egep-1hwuUGgQ0CPqNw):  This homework is all "pre-paper problems" and was given during the "Reading Stage"

[Sample Lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HUt9K0syo1bkN3TTFMYnVVRDg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-f23WnhgTS7N7_v2iUjK4IA):  This is one of the earlier lectures.

[Section 1 Wrap-Up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HUt9K0syo1QTdZQzdDZ21xOW8/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-6Xdjen2BLmo9b0S1Jo4S2A):  This is an example of the topics that we discussed during the wrap-up.  Here it is written like a lecture, but in the class much of this discussion was presented by students.
