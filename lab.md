## At <span style="color:#C45AEC">CoDE</span> Lab, we study how computational methods can uncover and address inequities in redistricting, voting, and beyond.

## Through modeling, mapping, and interdisciplinary collaboration, we bring quantitative insight to questions of justice and public good.

**Ongoing Research with Students:**

Studying the connectivity of the ReCom Metagraph, to better understand the technique of outlier analysis in detecting gerrymandering

Investigating the impact of disconnected precincts in constructing ensembles of redistricting maps

**Other Ongoing Research:**

Constructing Multimember districts and generating ranked-choice ballots (with VoteKit).  Studying the impact of the ballot-generation process, as well as the number of seats per district

**Completed Products with Students:**

USF graduate students Ananya Agarwal, Alusi, Arbie Hsu, Arif Syraj, and I have cleaned and coalesced data for post-2020-Census maps; the maps can be found at [https://github.com/eveomett-states](https://github.com/eveomett-states)
